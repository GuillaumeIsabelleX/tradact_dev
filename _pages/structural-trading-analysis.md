here about what is a structural trading analysis ?

* It contrast <b>linear analysis</b> and <b>non-linear analysis</b>.  These two methods of analysis are really different, in linear mode, you move from one point to another and in non-linear mode, you can move to any points within the structure you are analyzing like if it is a picture, a 3D object with which you can choose the perspective you want.  The possibilities of such non-linear dynamic analytic capabilities are endless compared to linear-analysis.
