<strong>"There is never is a Problem, there are structural conflicts"</strong>

That quote came to me this morning when I realized there never is problems !  There is just an orientation where you do not get what you want, therefore react, it is called structural conflict.  Structural Advancement (the opposite of structural conflict) is aiming toward what you want as that focus point give rise to an energy and motivation far beyond what problem solving has.

Following, I want to talk about :

"An approach to Data Synchronization Problem is just being structural conflict, it is bringing something in that will make something go away, the problem !"
